abstract: |
As school choice systems expand, policymakers increasingly seek ways to ensure they promote—not undermine—educational equity. I evaluate Washington, D.C.’s 2022 Equitable Access reform, which introduced controlled choice into its centralized school lottery to expand access for economically disadvantaged students. Using full administrative data for 2018 – 2024 lotteries, I replicate the deferred acceptance algorithm and simulate counterfactual lotteries under alternative rule, capacity, and demand configurations. A Shapley decomposition shows that EA rules substantially increased at-risk students’ access to charter schools (some by 250%), but not to traditional public schools, and that indirect effects (by shifting preferences) likely played a minor role. Instrumental-variable estimates leveraging lottery randomness indicate that when matched to an EA school economically advantaged applicants are no less likely to enroll or persist at the school, but are more likely to remain engaged in the system overall. Together, the results demonstrate that targeted modifications to school-choice algorithms can meaningfully expand access for disadvantaged students without disrupting overall market performance.
